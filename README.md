## Development Process

* Utilized React `React` dependency for building the project
* Utilized React `Jest` dependency for testing my code (functions and renders)
* Implemented smooth Scrolling between sections with `React-Scroll`.

## Challenges

* Jest is inconsistent at times
* Testing useStates seems to be impossible
* Getting grand children to set useStates in a Parent
* Infinite loops due to useEffects not wanting to update

## Final Outcome
